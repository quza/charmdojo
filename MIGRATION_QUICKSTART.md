# Quick Start: Applying the Girl Pool Migration

## Step 1: Apply the Database Migration

You need to apply the migration `003_girl_profiles_pool.sql` to your Supabase database.

### Option A: Using Supabase MCP (Recommended)

Simply tell the AI agent:

```
use supabase MCP to apply migration supabase/migrations/003_girl_profiles_pool.sql
```

The Supabase MCP will:
1. Connect to your Supabase project
2. Execute the migration SQL
3. Confirm table creation

### Option B: Manual Application via Supabase Dashboard

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/003_girl_profiles_pool.sql`
6. Paste into the SQL editor
7. Click **Run**

### Option C: Using Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
npx supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
npx supabase db execute --file supabase/migrations/003_girl_profiles_pool.sql
```

---

## Step 2: Verify Migration Success

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM girl_profiles;

-- Should return: 0 (empty table)

-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
  AND routine_name IN ('get_girl_pool_size', 'get_random_girls');

-- Should return: 2 rows
```

---

## Step 3: Test the System

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Make a Test Request

```bash
# You need to be authenticated
# The API will return pool size in metadata

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/game/generate-girls \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "girls": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "totalTime": 5.2,
    "poolSize": 0,        ‚Üê Should start at 0
    "poolMode": false     ‚Üê Should be false (generation mode)
  }
}
```

### Watch the Console

You should see:

```
üìä Current pool size: 0/2000
‚úì Pool building mode (2000 remaining)
üé® Generating image for Emma (with fallback)...
‚úì Generated 3/3 girls, added to pool
```

---

## Step 4: Monitor Pool Growth

After each request, the pool will grow:

```
Request 1: 0 ‚Üí 3 girls
Request 2: 3 ‚Üí 6 girls
Request 3: 6 ‚Üí 9 girls
...
Request 667: 1998 ‚Üí 2000 girls (full!)
```

Once the pool reaches 2000:

```
üìä Current pool size: 2000/2000
‚úì Pool at capacity, selecting from existing profiles
‚úì Selected 3 girls from pool
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Migration fails with "relation already exists"

The table might already exist. Drop it first:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.girl_profiles CASCADE;
-- Then re-run the migration
```

### "Function get_girl_pool_size does not exist"

Re-run the migration. The functions should be created automatically.

### Pool size not incrementing

Check the database:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM girl_profiles;
```

If it's not incrementing, check:
- Supabase connection is working
- No database errors in console logs
- `addGirlToPool()` function is being called

---

## Next Steps

Once the migration is applied:

1. ‚úÖ Make a few test requests
2. ‚úÖ Verify girls are being added to pool
3. ‚úÖ Check that attributes are stored correctly
4. ‚úÖ Test fallback systems (disable Imagen API key temporarily)
5. ‚úÖ Monitor until pool reaches 2000
