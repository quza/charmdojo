# Rate Limiting Fix - Girl Generation

## Problem
Users were hitting a 429 (Too Many Requests) error when trying to generate girls multiple times in quick succession. The rate limit was too restrictive:
- **Old limit:** 5 requests per 1 minute
- This was too low for testing and normal gameplay

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Rate Limiting** (`src/app/api/game/generate-girls/route.ts`)

#### Environment-Based Limits
- **Development Mode:** 20 requests per 1 minute (very generous for testing)
- **Production Mode:** 10 requests per 2 minutes (balanced for real usage)

#### Better Response Information
- Added rate limit headers to all responses:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit` - Maximum requests allowed
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Requests remaining in window
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset` - Timestamp when limit resets
  - `Retry-After` - Seconds until user can retry (on 429 errors)

#### Improved Error Messages
- Clear message showing exactly how long to wait
- Returns `secondsUntilReset` in the error response
- Dynamic plural handling ("1 minute" vs "2 minutes")

### 2. **Enhanced Frontend UX** (`src/app/(app)/game/selection/page.tsx`)

#### Better Error Handling
- Captures `secondsUntilReset` from 429 responses
- Different error titles for rate limits vs other errors
- Disables "Try Again" button while rate limited

#### State Management
- New state: `retryAfter` - tracks seconds until user can retry
- Automatically clears when countdown completes

### 3. **New Countdown Component** (`src/components/game/RateLimitCountdown.tsx`)

#### Features
- **Live countdown timer** showing minutes and seconds
- **Visual progress bar** that animates as time decreases
- **Auto-reset** - calls `onComplete()` when countdown reaches 0
- **Clear messaging** - "You can try again in X minutes and Y seconds"
- **Branded styling** - Uses CharmDojo colors and theme

## User Experience Flow

### Before the Fix
1. User generates girls 5 times
2. Gets error: "Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again."
3. No idea how long to wait
4. "Try Again" button works but will fail again

### After the Fix
1. User generates girls 20 times (dev) or 10 times (prod)
2. Gets clear error: "Too many generation requests. Please wait 2 minutes before trying again."
3. **Countdown timer shows:** "1m 45s" with visual progress bar
4. "Try Again" button is **disabled** during countdown
5. When countdown reaches 0:
   - Button automatically re-enables
   - Error message clears
   - User can try again

## Testing

### Development Testing
You now have **20 requests per minute**, which should be more than enough for testing.

### Production Behavior
In production, users get **10 requests per 2 minutes** (5 requests per minute average), which is reasonable for real gameplay while still protecting against abuse.

## Future Improvements

### For Production Scale
1. **Use Redis** instead of in-memory Map for rate limiting
   - Survives server restarts
   - Works across multiple server instances
   - Better for serverless deployments

2. **Add caching** for generated girls
   - Cache generated girls for 5-10 minutes
   - Reduce API costs
   - Faster response times

3. **Add request queuing**
   - Queue requests when rate limited
   - Auto-retry when limit resets
   - Better UX for edge cases

## Code Changes Summary

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `route.ts` | - Environment-based limits<br>- Enhanced rate limit function<br>- Better error responses<br>- Rate limit headers |
| `page.tsx` | - New `retryAfter` state<br>- Extract retry seconds from 429<br>- Conditional error titles<br>- Disabled button during rate limit |
| `RateLimitCountdown.tsx` | - New component<br>- Live countdown timer<br>- Visual progress bar<br>- Auto-complete callback |

## Environment Detection

The system automatically detects the environment:
```typescript
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
```

No configuration needed - it just works!
