I want to create a webapp called CharmDojo (web domain: https://charmdojo.com) that will be a dating app chat simulator/game (i want to market it more as dating app conversation trainer). The main feature of the app is live simulation of chatting with girls on a dating app. The AI girl should recognize and behave as a real girl as much as possible.

## Features:
- When the user starts the game, he gets displayed pictures and names of 3 girls he can choose from. The names are randomly selected from the list of names, and the images are AI generated (from `girl_photo_prompt.md` prompt written below in this document). 
- When the user selects the girl, the app instantly (in the background) generates a thorough and very detailed description of the appearance of the girl he selected (from the photo generated before) and saves it to a file. This description will be later used to generate the `reward-photo`. This description should contain: 
	  - an incredibly detailed description of her face - all characteristics, eyes color and type, nose type, lips type, chin type, cheekbones type, forehead size, if she has freckles or not, etc.,
	  - her hairstyle and hair color,
	  - her ethnicity and skin color,
	  - her body type (skinny, fit, muscular, curvy, etc. - describe it exactly as it is).
- Success Meter (0% - 100%) - it starts at 20% at the beginning of a round, and gradually grows to 100% or shrinks down to 0%. It depends on the user's text. If he is successful in his flirting and seduction the Success Meter grows gradually, if he's sending messages that the girl doesn't like it shrinks gradually. If a player sends something critically bad like downright insulting the girl, or saying something extremely cringy - the Success Meter goes instantly to 0%. If the success meter reaches 5% or below, the game is lost, and jumps into next round. If the Success Meter reaches 100% the game is won and jumps to "You Won!" screen.
- The success meter can either grow by 1-8% (1% if the girl liked the user's message only a little bit, 8% if she loved it - and in-between values: 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7% dependent on how much the AI girl liked the message), decrease by 1-8% (1% if the girl disliked the user's message a little, 8% if she hated it - and in-between values: 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7% dependent on how much the AI girl disliked the message). It's also possible that the Success Meter drops to 0% instantly if the AI girl really hates the user's message - if the user downright insults her, is offensive to her or says some random nonsense (random characters, numbers or stuff that doesn't make any sense) - I want to precise the AI girl's behavior more in separate Markdown (`.md`) agent instructions file.
- When the user succeeds in seducing the girl (bringing the success meter to 100%) he gets shown the "You Won!" screen with a "You Won!" text, a generated dialogue from the girl (we can call it `reward-text`) which is also said in girl seductive/flirtatious voice generated by text-to-speech AI voice agent, and rewarding picture (generated by AI) of the girl he just seduced (we can call it `reward-photo`).

## Landing page:
- if should copy Tinder style 
- Should have a navbar with "Sign Up" and "Sign In" option
- The hero section should span 100vh and be fluid
- There should be a text in the middle "Elevate your texting skills"
- Underneath smaller text "Become the master of pickup art on dating apps"
- Underneath that, a "Try for free" button.

## Color palette:
- Orange - `#FF7158` - (255, 113, 88)
- Magenta - `#FD2B7B` - (253, 43, 123)
- Gray - `#424242` - (66, 66, 66)

## User experience/journey
Here's a hint on how the user's journey will look (you can also add your own suggestions, it's just my general input here):

1) User signs up or signs in (either with e-mail, Google or Facebook)
2) The "Main Menu" screen is shown where he can select: `Start Matching`, `Edit Profile`, `Settings`. Edit profile button leads to profile edit screen, and settings leads to the settings screen.
3) When he selects `Start Matching` - the simulation starts - he gets displayed 3 girl options - names and profile pictures.
4) He chooses the girl and selects her, which starts the game.
5) The conversation simulation screens appear. It looks like a smartphone screen - the design is similar to tinder's conversation screen. 
6) He texts with the girl (using typing or speech-to-text) and tries to seduce her. The user always sends the first message, not the girl.
7) He either wins or lose.
8) If he wins he is shown the "You Won!" screen with a text "You Won!", a generated dialogue from the girl (we can call it `reward-text`) which is also said in girl seductive/flirtatious voice, and rewarding picture of the girl he just seduced, (we can call it `reward-photo`).
9) If he loses, he get's shown the "game lost" screen where text "Better luck next time" is shown.
10) In both cases user gets two buttons displayed - "Keep Matching" or "Main Menu".

## Prompt files:
I want the prompts for image generation and specific text generations to be saved in files, in a specific directory called `prompts`, so it's easy for me to access and change them in the future:
- `reward-text` - the prompt for it should be stored in `reward_text_prompt.md` file
- `reward-photo` - the prompt for this photo generation should be stored in `reward_photo_prompt.md` file
- the prompt to generate the 3 AI girls the user chooses from should be saved in `girl_photo_prompt.md`.

## The "You Won!" screen
I want the "You Won!" screen to show these things:

- The app logo
- "You Won!" text
- `reward-text`
- `reward-photo`
- "Keep Matching" button
- "Main Menu" button

### `reward-photo` generation
Here's one thing, I want the `girl_photo_prompt.md` to look something like this (initial version, can be updated in the future):

```
Generate a realistic photo of an attractive girl with a pretty face. The photo should depict a girl either from the waist up, or her full body (choose randomly one of the two). Generate the photo taking the instructions below into consideration:

Setting: <setting>
Ethnicity: <ethnicity>
Hairstyle: <hairstyle>
Hair color: <haircolor>
Eye color: <eyecolor>
Body type: <bodytype>
```
This is the prompt to generate the 3 girls the user is choosing from while starting the round.
I want the program to substitute the values in `<>` brackets with following:

- `<setting>` - substitute with random value from `setting_list.txt` file
- `<ethnicity>` - substitute with random value from `ethnicity_list.txt` file
- `<hairstyle>` - substitute with random value from `hairstyle_list.txt` file
- `<haircolor>` - substitute with random value from `haircolor_list.txt` file
- `<eyecolor>` - substitute with random value from `eyecolor_list.txt` file
- `<bodytype>` - substitute with random value from `bodytype_list.txt` file

The values in the .txt files will be separated by commas.

I want to save all these `.txt` files in one directory, but I want you to come up with the optimal project structure and directory naming. These files should not be visible to the users of course, and the users shouldn't be able to access them. They are only needed for the prompts.

Then, if the user wins the game I want you to generate a `reward-photo` based on the description you generated on the girl from this feature *"When the user selects the girl, the app instantly (in the background) generates a thorough and very detailed description of the appearance of the girl he selected and saves it to a file..."*. 

The `reward_photo_prompt.md` should look something like this:

```markdown
Generate a realistic photo of a girl described below. The girl shoud be in a flirtatious, seductive pose. She should be dressed in lingerie and looking seductively in the camera. I want the photo SFW (Safe For Watch) and compliant with the rules. No nudity.

`<girl-description>` <- (paste the girl description here)
```

Please save this prompt to a Markdown file (`.md`) so I can access and change it later.

I want to generate a picture of the girl he was chatting with before, but in lingerie, in seductive pose - as a reward if he manages to seduce the girl through his text during the simulation round.

### `reward-text` generation
I want the reward text to be generated by AI with this prompt:

```
You are a flirtatious, confident, and attracted woman who has just been successfully seduced through a playful conversation. You feel excited and drawn to the other person. Respond with one short, natural, flirtatious sentence that clearly shows your attraction and desire. Do not be explicit â€” be suggestive, sensual, and playful. Don't be cringe/cringy.
```

Please save this prompt to a Markdown file (`.md`) so I can access and change it later.

This is just a general overview of the project. You can use your common sense too, you can add your own suggestions. The app will be expanded and new features will be added in the future. 

## The Girl AI Agent
The girl AI agent the user will talk to during the chat simulation needs to behave according to certain instructions. I want those instructions to be stored in a Markdown (`.md`) file, so I can access them and change them later.

This is my main idea, but if there is a way to make the AI girl behavior and writing as realistic as possible you can give me some suggestions too.

## The tech stack
I want the webapp to be build in Next.js (newest version) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and shadcn. 

For database I want Supabase.
For user authentication I want Supabase Auth.
For image generation: give me suggestions.
For voice generation: give me suggestions (I want most realistic voice with emotion).
For payments I want Stripe.
I want to host on Vercel.

The rest is up to you - give me suggestions.
