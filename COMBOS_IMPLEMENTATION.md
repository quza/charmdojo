# Combos System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

The Combos system has been successfully implemented! This feature rewards players for consecutive successful messages with increasing success meter multipliers.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `current_combo` and `highest_combo` columns to `game_rounds` table
- Added `combo_at_message` column to `messages` table for historical tracking

### 2. Core System (`combo-system.ts`)
- Combo multiplier progression: 1x → 1.2x → 1.4x → 1.6x → 1.8x → 2x
- Combo advancement: Requires delta ≥ +3
- Combo maintenance: Delta 0 to +2 keeps combo
- Combo breaking: Delta < 0 resets combo to 0
- Maximum delta cap: +14 (after multiplier)

### 3. State Management
- Added combo tracking to `gameStore.ts`
- Updated `useGame` hook with combo state and actions
- Combo state persists across page reloads

### 4. UI Components
- **ComboIndicator**: Displays current combo level with animated background
  - Combo 0: Gray, neutral
  - Combo x1: Blue glow
  - Combo x2: Purple glow
  - Combo x3: Orange glow
  - Combo x4: Red glow
  - Combo x5: "ON FIRE!" with animated fire gradient background
- Tooltip shows current multiplier on hover
- Animations trigger on combo increase/break

### 5. Sound Effects
- Combo increase: Ascending beep (pitch increases with combo level)
- High combos (x4-x5): Enhanced sound with harmonics
- Combo break: Descending "whoosh" sound
- All sounds generated with Web Audio API (no external files)

### 6. Chat API Integration
- Combo logic integrated into message processing
- Original delta used for combo advancement/breaking
- Multiplied delta used for success meter calculation
- Combo info returned in API response

## How It Works

### Flow
1. User sends message
2. AI evaluates message → generates `originalDelta` (-8 to +8)
3. System checks combo status:
   - If `originalDelta >= +3`: Advance combo (max 5)
   - If `originalDelta 0-2`: Maintain combo
   - If `originalDelta < 0`: Break combo (reset to 0)
4. Apply multiplier to delta: `finalDelta = originalDelta * multiplier`
5. Cap finalDelta at +14
6. Update success meter with `finalDelta`
7. Update UI with combo animation and play sound

### Example Scenarios

**Building a Combo:**
- Message 1: Delta +5 → Combo becomes x1 (1.2x multiplier ready for next)
- Message 2: Delta +6 → Becomes +7 after 1.2x → Combo becomes x2
- Message 3: Delta +7 → Becomes +9 after 1.4x → Combo becomes x3
- Message 4: Delta +8 → Becomes +12 after 1.6x → Combo becomes x4
- Message 5: Delta +8 → Becomes +14 (capped) after 1.8x → Combo becomes x5 "ON FIRE!"

**Maintaining a Combo:**
- Combo x3, Message: Delta +2 → No multiplier, no advancement, combo stays at x3

**Breaking a Combo:**
- Combo x5, Message: Delta -3 → Combo resets to 0, whoosh sound plays

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Basic Functionality
- [ ] Combo starts at 0 for new rounds
- [ ] Combo advances when delta >= +3
- [ ] Combo maintains when delta is 0-2
- [ ] Combo breaks when delta < 0
- [ ] Combo caps at level 5

### ✅ Multiplier Effects
- [ ] Verify multipliers: 1.0x, 1.2x, 1.4x, 1.6x, 1.8x, 2.0x
- [ ] Confirm delta is multiplied correctly
- [ ] Confirm final delta is capped at +14

### ✅ Visual Feedback
- [ ] ComboIndicator displays correct text
- [ ] Colors change appropriately (gray → blue → purple → orange → red → fire)
- [ ] "ON FIRE!" appears at combo x5
- [ ] Fire animation plays at combo x5
- [ ] Increase animation (scale up + glow) plays when advancing
- [ ] Break animation (shake) plays when combo breaks
- [ ] Tooltip shows correct multiplier

### ✅ Sound Effects
- [ ] Sound plays when combo increases
- [ ] Pitch increases with combo level
- [ ] Enhanced sound at x4 and x5
- [ ] Whoosh sound plays when combo breaks
- [ ] No sound when combo maintains (delta 0-2)

### ✅ Persistence
- [ ] Combo persists after page reload
- [ ] Highest combo is tracked
- [ ] Combo resets properly for new rounds

### ✅ Edge Cases
- [ ] Multiple positive messages in a row build combo correctly
- [ ] Single negative message resets even from max combo
- [ ] Delta +8 at combo x5 caps at +14 (not +16)
- [ ] Ghosting resets combo to 0
- [ ] Instant fail resets combo to 0

## Notes

- XP is calculated from the **original delta**, not the multiplied delta (prevents combo from affecting XP progression)
- Combo state is stored in both database (for persistence) and Zustand store (for UI reactivity)
- Audio context is initialized on first user interaction to comply with browser autoplay policies
- All animations use CSS for smooth 60fps performance

## Ready to Test!

Start a new game round and try:
1. Send several good messages (+3 or higher) to build your combo
2. Watch the ComboIndicator change colors and animations
3. Listen for the sound effects
4. Try sending a neutral message (+1) to maintain the combo
5. Send a bad message to break the combo and hear the whoosh
6. Build up to "ON FIRE!" and see the fire animation!
