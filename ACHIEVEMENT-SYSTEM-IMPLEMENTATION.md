# Achievement System Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete achievement system for CharmDojo with 3 initial achievements. The system includes database tables, backend logic, API endpoints, frontend UI components, and automatic unlocking with toast notifications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database (Supabase)

**Tables Created:**
- `achievements` - Stores achievement definitions
- `user_achievements` - Junction table tracking which users have unlocked which achievements

**Initial Achievements Seeded:**
1. **Young Rizzie** - "Win your first simulation"
   - Unlocks when: `total_wins >= 1`
   - Icon: Trophy with star

2. **That's 3!** - "Get a 3 charm winstreak"
   - Unlocks when: `current_streak >= 3`
   - Icon: Flames with number 3

3. **Quick Closer** - "Win a simulation in fewer than 10 messages"
   - Unlocks when: Any game round with `result='win'` and `message_count < 10`
   - Icon: Lightning bolt with speed lines

**Security:**
- RLS policies enabled on both tables
- Anyone can read achievements (public definitions)
- Users can only read/insert their own user_achievements

### 2. Backend Services

**Achievement Service** (`src/lib/services/achievement-service.ts`):
- `checkAndUnlockAchievements(userId)` - Main function to check all achievements and unlock any newly earned ones
- `getUserAchievements(userId)` - Get all achievements with user's unlock status
- Individual checker functions for each achievement type
- Automatic `total_achievements` count updates

**Integration Points:**
- Automatically checks achievements after game completion (in `/api/chat/message` route)
- Checks achievements when main menu loads (in `/api/user/achievements` route)

### 3. API Endpoints

**GET /api/user/achievements**
- Returns all achievements with locked/unlocked status
- Auto-checks for newly unlocked achievements
- Returns `newlyUnlocked` array for toast notifications

**Updated: GET /api/user/stats**
- Now calculates real `totalAchievements` count from database
- Previously returned hardcoded 0

### 4. Frontend Components

**AchievementCard** (`src/components/game/AchievementCard.tsx`):
- Displays achievement icon, title, and unlock status
- Locked achievements: Grayed out, dimmed, with lock icon overlay
- Unlocked achievements: Full color, hover effects, "Unlocked" badge
- Tooltip on hover showing achievement description
- Uses shadcn/ui Tooltip component

**AchievementToast** (`src/components/game/AchievementToast.tsx`):
- Utility functions for displaying achievement unlock toasts
- `showAchievementToast(achievement)` - Single toast
- `showAchievementToasts(achievements)` - Multiple toasts with staggered timing (500ms)
- 5-second auto-dismiss
- Trophy emoji with achievement details

**Updated: Main Menu** (`src/app/(app)/main-menu/page.tsx`):
- New "Your Achievements" section below "Your Progress"
- 3-column grid layout for achievements
- Fetches achievements on page load and when returning from game
- Automatically shows toast notifications for newly unlocked achievements
- Loading skeleton states

### 5. Placeholder Images

**Created SVG icons in `/public/achievements/`:**
- `young_rizzie.svg` - Trophy with star (gold/pink gradient)
- `thats_3.svg` - Flames with number 3 (orange/pink gradient)
- `quick_closer.svg` - Lightning bolt with speed lines (green/blue gradient)

Each icon is 200x200px, scalable SVG format with brand-consistent gradients.

### 6. Type Definitions

**New file: `src/types/achievement.ts`**
- `Achievement` interface
- `AchievementsResponse` interface
- `AchievementKey` type

**Updated: `src/types/database.ts`**
- Regenerated with new `achievements` and `user_achievements` tables

## User Flow

1. **User wins their first game:**
   - Chat API updates user stats (`total_wins` increments)
   - Achievement service checks all achievements
   - "Young Rizzie" unlocks automatically
   - User returns to main menu
   - Toast notification appears: "🏆 Achievement Unlocked! Young Rizzie"
   - Achievement card appears in color (no longer grayed out)

2. **User gets 3-win streak:**
   - Chat API updates `current_streak` to 3
   - Achievement service detects streak >= 3
   - "That's 3!" unlocks
   - Toast notification shows on next main menu visit

3. **User wins in <10 messages:**
   - Game round saved with `message_count < 10` and `result='win'`
   - Achievement service queries for fast wins
   - "Quick Closer" unlocks
   - Toast notification appears

## Technical Details

### Achievement Checking Strategy

**Dual-checking approach:**
1. **After game completion** - Immediate checking when game ends
2. **On page load** - Catches any missed achievements

This ensures achievements are never missed due to timing issues.

### Performance Optimizations

- Achievement definitions cached in database (rarely change)
- Single database query to check all unlocked achievements
- Idempotent checking (safe to call multiple times)
- Batch updates for multiple achievements

### Database Indexes

Created indexes on:
- `user_achievements.user_id` - Fast lookups by user
- `user_achievements.achievement_id` - Fast lookups by achievement

### Future Extensibility

Adding new achievements is straightforward:
1. Insert new row into `achievements` table
2. Add checker function in `achievement-service.ts`
3. Create new icon SVG
4. Deploy - existing users will retroactively unlock if criteria met

## Files Created/Modified

1. `src/types/achievement.ts`
2. `src/lib/services/achievement-service.ts`
3. `src/app/api/user/achievements/route.ts`

2. `src/app/api/user/stats/route.ts` - Calculate real achievement count
3. `src/app/api/chat/message/route.ts` - Added achievement checking
4. `src/app/(app)/main-menu/page.tsx` - Added achievements section

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database tables created with proper schema
- [x] RLS policies configured correctly
- [x] Achievement definitions seeded
- [x] TypeScript types generated
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] No linting errors

### Manual Testing Required:

1. Create new account and win first game → "Young Rizzie" unlocks
2. Win 3 games in a row → "That's 3!" unlocks
3. Win a game in <10 messages → "Quick Closer" unlocks
4. Verify locked achievements appear grayed out with lock icon
5. Verify unlocked achievements appear in full color
6. Hover over achievement → Tooltip shows description
7. Return to main menu after unlocking → Toast notification appears
8. Verify "Total Achievements" stat updates correctly

## Known Limitations

1. Achievement images are placeholder SVGs (can be replaced with custom PNG/WebP later)
2. No animation on unlock (confetti could be added)
3. No achievement details page (could show unlock date, rarity, etc.)
4. No achievement history/timeline view

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. Add more achievements (e.g., "Smooth Operator" - 10 wins, "Charm Master" - 50 wins)
2. Add achievement rarity tiers (Common, Rare, Epic)
3. Add progress bars for incremental achievements
4. Add achievement sound effects
5. Add sharing functionality (share unlocks to social media)
6. Add achievement leaderboard
7. Add secret/hidden achievements
